Description: C++ layer over libupnp.
 libupnpp wraps libnpupnp calls and data inside easier to use C++ constructs.
 It can be used to build either devices or control points. 
 The library exists mostly to the support the upmpdcli media renderer and
 the upplay control point and its interface is probably not ready or stable
 enough for wider use.
