=== libupnpp : a C++ wrapper for libupnp

libupnpp defines useful objects over libupnp and can be used to create both
devices and control points. It is shared by upmpdcli and upplay.

There is
link:https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/libupnpp-refdoc/libupnpp-ctl.html[an
embryo of documentation] for the Control Point side of the library.

The include files are somewhat commented, and there are a bunch of small
sample programs (both for the control and device side) in the
link:https://github.com/medoc92/libupnpp-samples[libupnpp-samples] repository.

Also upmpdcli and upplay are quite complete examples...
